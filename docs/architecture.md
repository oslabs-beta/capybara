This document provides a comprehensive overview of Coffybara's system architecture, design decisions, and technical implementation.

## System Architecture

</p>

Coffybara follows a **microservices architecture** with real-time event processing and AI powered analysis capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Event Collection Layer

**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**

- Source of all Kubernetes events
- Monitors pod lifecycle, resource usage, and system events
- Streams events to Google Pub/Sub in real-time

**Google Cloud Pub/Sub**

- Acts as the event streaming backbone
- Decouples event production from consumption
- Provides reliable, scalable message delivery
- Handles event ordering and delivery guarantees

### 2. Event Processing Layer

**Node.js Backend (Express)**

- Consumes events from Pub/Sub subscriptions
- Implements intelligent filtering and deduplication
- Coordinates AI analysis and notification workflows
- Provides REST API for frontend communication

**Redis Cache**

- Implements rate limiting for event processing
- Caches frequently accessed data
- Provides session storage for real-time connections
- Prevents duplicate event processing

### 3. AI Analysis Layer

**Pinecone Vector Database**

- Stores vector embeddings of historical events
- Enables semantic similarity search
- Provides context for AI analysis
- Scales automatically with data volume

**Google Gemini AI**

- Generates embeddings for event vectorization
- Performs natural language analysis of events
- Provides intelligent recommendations
- Contextualizes events with historical data

### 4. Notification Layer

**Slack Integration**

- Delivers formatted alerts to development teams
- Provides contextual information and recommendations
- Supports rich message formatting
- Enables team collaboration on incidents

**WebSocket (Socket.IO)**

- Provides real-time updates to dashboard
- Maintains persistent connections with clients
- Broadcasts events to multiple connected users
- Enables real-time collaboration features

### 5. User Interface Layer

**React Frontend**

- Modern, responsive web application
- Real-time event dashboard with live updates
- Historical analytics and trend visualization
- User authentication and authorization

**Clerk Authentication**

- OAuth 2.0 integration with Google
- Secure user session management
- Role-based access control
- SSO capabilities for enterprise users

## Data Flow

### 1. Event Ingestion

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[GKE Cluster] --> B[Cloud Pub/Sub]
    B --> C[Backend Subscriber]
    C --> D[Redis Cache]
    C --> E[Event Processor]
```

1. **GKE clusters** generate Kubernetes events
2. **Cloud Pub/Sub** receives and queues events
3. **Backend service** subscribes to events
4. **Redis** provides deduplication and rate limiting
5. **Event processor** validates and enriches events

### 2. AI Analysis Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Event] --> B[Gemini AI]
    B --> C[Vector Embedding]
    C --> D[Pinecone Search]
    D --> E[Similar Events]
    E --> F[AI Analysis]
    F --> G[Recommendations]
```

1. **Events** are sent to Gemini AI for embedding generation
2. **Vector embeddings** are stored in Pinecone
3. **Similarity search** finds related historical events
4. **AI analysis** provides context and recommendations
5. **Results** are formatted for notifications

### 3. Real-time Distribution

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Processed Event] --> B[WebSocket]
    A --> C[Slack API]
    B --> D[Dashboard]
    C --> E[Slack Channel]
```

1. **Processed events** are distributed via multiple channels
2. **WebSocket** delivers real-time updates to dashboard
3. **Slack API** sends formatted notifications
4. **Users** receive immediate alerts
